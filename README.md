In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

1. What the project does:
In this project we created a database in MySQL Workbench and connected to our server so that we could call the database from our javascript file within the terminal.  We also created a table and functions that would prompt responses from the user as well as calculating the purchase.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it teaches us to use MySQL, create tables and insert data within MySQL workbench and then connecting to the server in order to call the database and make adjustments within the javascript.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with this project by creating a database and javascript file that connects to your local server.  They can also review my repository for this project and review the code in the javascript file and database.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If users need help with the project then they can go to my repo and review the code.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
This project was maintained and contributed by Will Altherr.  In order for me to complete this project I had to use resources online inlcuding other repositories that have completed this project.
